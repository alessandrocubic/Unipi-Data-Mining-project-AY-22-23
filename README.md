### Abstract
Data Mining project carried out on two datasets extracted from the <b>Twitter</b> platform, one on users and one on Tweets. The project consists of data analysis based on data mining tools divided into four tasks:
<br /><br />
Task 1: <b>Data Understanding and Preparation</b>
> Task 1.1: <b>Data Understanding</b>, explore the dataset with the analytical tools. Evaluate data quality, distribution of variables and pairwise correlations
> 
> Task 1.2: <b>Data Preparation</b>, improve the quality of the data and prepare them by extracting new interesting features to describe the user and their behaviour from the information gathered from tweets

Task 2: <b>Clustering analysis</b>, based on the userâ€™s profile explore the dataset using various clustering techniques
<br /><br />
Task 3: <b>Predictive Analysis</b>, consider the problem of predicting for each user the label which is a binary variable that indicates if a user is a bot or a genuine user
<br /><br />
Task 4: <b>Time Series Analysis</b>, conduct an analysis of the time series extracted in the year 2019
